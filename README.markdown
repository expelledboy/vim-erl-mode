=================================

I dont know much about emacs, or erlang-mode, but this is an attempt to
reproduce the environment.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and
paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle git clone git://github.com/expelledboy/vim-erl-mode.git
